**ThreatCorrelator** helps you instantly spot known malicious actors in your log files by correlating them with up-to-date threat intelligence feeds. No security expertise required‚Äîjust point it at your logs and get clear, actionable results.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
poetry install
poetry run streamlit run src/threatcorrelator/dashboard.py
```

*Sample logs and config are included for instant demo‚Äîno API keys needed for basic testing!*

## Features

- **Multi-Source Threat Feeds:** Checks your logs against AbuseIPDB, AlienVault OTX, and more.
- **IOC Correlation:** Finds both IP and domain matches in your logs.
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** Tags each threat with a known tactic/technique.
- **Severity & Country Context:** Flags critical threats and shows their origin.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Visualize, filter, and download results easily.

---

## How It Works

1. **Fetch Threat Feeds** ‚Üí 2. **Store in Local DB** ‚Üí 3. **Correlate with Your Logs** ‚Üí 4. **Enrich & Classify** ‚Üí 5. **Visualize & Export**

---

## Example Use Case

- **Web Server Security:** Scan your Apache logs and instantly see if any visitors‚Äô IPs are known malicious. Block and investigate as needed.
